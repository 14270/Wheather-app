ðŸš€ Just Completed My Weather Application! ðŸŒ¦

Excited to share my latest projectâ€”a Weather Application packed with features to provide accurate and real-time weather updates.

ðŸ”¥ Key Features:

âœ… Search Bar â€“ Easily search for weather updates in any city or country.
âœ… Location-Based Data â€“ Fetch weather details using longitude & latitude.
âœ… Real-Time Weather Metrics â€“ Includes humidity, real feel, wind speed, and direction.
âœ… Forecasting â€“ Get a 3-hour step forecast and daily forecast for better planning.
âœ… Sunrise & Sunset Timings â€“ Stay updated with accurate daylight timings.
âœ… Temperature Units â€“ Switch between Â°F and Â°C effortlessly.
âœ… Weather Notifications â€“ Get instant alerts on weather changes.

Built using React.js and APIs to fetch real-time weather data. This project helped me sharpen my skills in API integration, state management, and UI/UX design.

ðŸ”— Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions! ðŸš€
